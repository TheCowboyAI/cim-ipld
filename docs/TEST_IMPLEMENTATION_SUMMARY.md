   - Network failures, storage errors, corruption handling

4. **Deduplication Tests** (`tests/deduplication_tests.rs`)
   - 7 test functions for content deduplication
   - Cross-bucket, concurrent, and compression scenarios

5. **Metadata Tests** (`tests/metadata_tests.rs`)
   - 6 test functions for metadata operations
   - Storage, retrieval, search, and versioning

6. **Backend Tests** (`tests/backend_tests.rs`)
   - 8 test functions for storage backend operations
   - Mock S3 and filesystem backends with failure scenarios

7. **Codec Tests** (`tests/codec_tests.rs`)
   - 8 test functions for codec operations
   - Custom codecs, compression, versioning

8. **Migration Tests** (`tests/migration_tests.rs`)
   - 6 test functions for data migration
   - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, IPFS sources with incremental support

9. **Integration/E2E Tests** (`tests/integration/e2e_tests.rs`)
   - 5 comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios
   - Complete workflows, event sourcing, multi-domain integration

10. **Load Tests** (`tests/load_tests.rs`)
    - 5 performance and stress test scenarios
    - Throughput, scalability, burst traffic handling

11. **Performance Benchmarks** (`benches/performance_bench.rs`)
    - 16 benchmark functions covering all major operations
    - Storage, chain, cache, codec, and batch operations

### üìÅ Test Infrastructure

- **Common Test Utilities** (`tests/common/mod.rs`)
  - Shared test helpers and mock implementations
  - `TestContent`, `TestContext`, `NatsTestHarness`
  - Mock backends and assertion helpers

- **Test Documentation** (`tests/README.md`)
  - Comprehensive guide to test structure and coverage
  - Running instructions and requirements

## Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Coverage
- All 6 epics from the test coverage assessment are now 100% covered
- All user stories have corresponding test cases
- Critical gaps in security, concurrency, and production-readiness addressed

### 2. Test Organization
- Clear structure with dedicated files for each test category
- Integration tests in separate directory
- Benchmarks in standard Rust bench directory
- Comprehensive documentation

### 3. Test Quality
- Each test includes Mermaid diagrams in documentation
- Clear Given-When-Then structure
- Proper error handling and assertions
- Use of `#[ignore]` for tests requiring external dependencies

### 4. Performance Testing
- Load tests for high-throughput scenarios
- Benchmarks for performance measurement
- Stress tests for system limits
- Scalability tests up to 1 million objects

## Technical Highlights

### Mock Implementations
- `MockS3Backend` - Simulates S3-compatible storage with configurable latency and failure rates
- `MockFilesystemBackend` - Local filesystem simulation with space constraints
- `MockPostgresSource`, `MockMongoSource`, `MockIpfsSource` - Data migration sources

### Test Patterns
- Async test support with `tokio::test`
- Concurrent test scenarios using `Arc` and `tokio::spawn`
- Performance metrics collection with atomic counters
- Proper resource cleanup with `TempDir`

### Integration Points
- NATS JetStream integration tests
- Cross-domain event flow testing
- Event sourcing with state reconstruction
- Backup and restore workflows

## Usage Instructions

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests (no external dependencies)
cargo test --lib

# Run all tests including integration (requires NATS)
nats-server -js &
cargo test -- --include-ignored
```

### Running Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Security tests only
cargo test --test security_tests

# Load tests (extended runtime)
cargo test --test load_tests -- --ignored --test-threads=1

# Benchmarks (requires nightly)
cargo +nightly bench
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically
   - Include NATS server in CI environment
   - Track performance metrics over time

2. **Additional Testing**
   - Property-based testing with proptest
   - Fuzzing for security-critical components
   - Chaos engineering for resilience

3. **Test Maintenance**
   - Regular review of test coverage
   - Update tests as new features are added
   - Performance baseline tracking

## Conclusion

The CIM-IPLD test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of all identified user stories and requirements. The implementation follows best practices for Rust testing, includes proper documentation, and provides a solid foundation for ensuring the reliability and performance of the CIM-IPLD module.
